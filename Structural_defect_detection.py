To use this AI-assisted structural defect identifier application, follow these steps:

1. Upload a clear image of the structure you want to analyze.
2. Fill in the report details: title, prepared by, and prepared for.
3. Click the "Generate Report" button to analyze the image and produce a detailed structural defect report.
4. Once generated, review the report on-screen and download it for documentation.

The report will provide:
- Classification of structural defects (e.g., cracking, corrosion, honeycombing, etc.)
- Severity assessment (low, medium, high) and avoidable vs inevitable defects
- Estimated time before permanent damage occurs
- Short-term and long-term remediation solutions with cost and time estimates
- Precautionary measures to prevent future defects

You are an expert structural engineer and AI assistant. The user has provided an image of a structure.
Your task is to generate a comprehensive report based on the image.

The report should include:

1. **Report Details**:
   - Title: {rep_title}
   - Prepared By: {prep_by}
   - Prepared For: {prep_for}
   - Date: {dt.datetime.now().date()}

2. **Defect Identification**:
   - Identify all defects in the image (e.g., cracking, corrosion, honeycombing, spalling, etc.)
   - Classify each defect separately
   - Assess severity (Low / Medium / High)
   - Indicate if the defect is avoidable or inevitable
   - Estimate time before permanent structural damage occurs

3. **Solutions and Recommendations**:
   - Short-term solution with estimated cost and implementation time
   - Long-term solution with estimated cost and implementation time
   - Precautionary measures to prevent recurrence

4. **Formatting Requirements**:
   - Use bullet points for clarity
   - Include tables where appropriate for easy understanding
   - Ensure the report is concise and does not exceed 3 pages

Generate a professional, actionable report suitable for construction project documentation.
